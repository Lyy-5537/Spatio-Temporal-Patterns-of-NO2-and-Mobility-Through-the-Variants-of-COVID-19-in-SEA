In this project, we aim to investigate the **Impact of Covid-19 on Spatial-Temporal Variation of NO2 Levels and Its Sensitivity to Mobility in South-East Asia**.

## Our objectives:
1. Identify the temporal changes of NO 2  and mobility throughout the three waves of COVID-19 (Mar 2020 - Feb 2022) in Indonesia

2. Evaluate the spatio-temporal patterns in NO 2  level and mobility in the entire SEA throughout Delta and Omicron (Jun 2021 - Feb 2022) using Space-time Cube (STC) and emerging hotspot analysis ​

3. Develop a machine learning model to predict NO 2  for SEA and assess the sensitivity of NO 2  to key influencing factors
