# NO2-in-South-East-Asia-_GE5219
We aim to investigate the **Impact of Covid-19 on Spatial-Temporal Variation of NO2 Levels and Its Sensitivity to Mobility in South-East Asia**.

Our objectives:
1. Evaluate the continuous change in NO2 level and mobility in SEA and South Asia throughout the three waves of COVID-19 variant (2020 Mar – 2021 Feb)
2. Propose, Train and Develop a Spatio-temporal model (CNN-LSTM) for future NO2 level forecast and analysis. ​
3. Compare the performance of CNN-LSTM with MLP (no spatial and temporal aspect), CNN(no temporal component
